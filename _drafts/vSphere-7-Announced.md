# Introduction

On March 10th 2020 VMware announced VMware vSphere 7.0. This is a major leap in the underpinning technology in vSphere and as Vmware are advertising this is the future of App Modernization in a Multi-Cloud World.

In this blog post I want to share what I have found interesting in all the announcements, some links and further information.

## VMware Announcement

VMware revealed vSphere 7.0 in a pre-recorded webcast. You can watch the replay at this [link](https://www.vmware.com/app-modernization.html). This video gives some high level marketing information about the release and an accompanying datasheet is available [here](https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/digitalmarketing/vmware/en/pdf/products/vsan/vmw-vsphere-datasheet.pdf).
