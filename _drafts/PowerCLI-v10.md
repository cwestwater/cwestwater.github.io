# Introduction

Earlier this month [VMware released PowerCLI v10.0.0](https://blogs.vmware.com/PowerCLI/2018/02/powercli-10.html). The previous version was v6.5.4 so you may be wondering why the big jump in version numbers. This apparently was due to a number of reasons but I personally like it was because PowerCLI is 10 years old so seemed appropriate to be v10. In this post I will details how to update to it and integrations 

The main selling point on this version is that it's cross platform. You can now run PowerCLI natively on Windows, Mac and Linux. The prerequisite for Mac and Linux is that PowerShell Core must be installed.
