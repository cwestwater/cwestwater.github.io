# Introduction

On the run up to VMworld I see posts with tips that people have for attending VMworld. VMware also recently put out a tweet for tips. I thought I would consolidate those tips from all the people into this one location. As I see more I will update this post.

## Travel Tips

* When buying your pass for VMworld you can also book your hotel. VMware have negotiated discounted rates at hotels. The list is available [here](https://www.vmworld.com/content/dam/digitalmarketing/vmworld/assets/wcm/pdf/vmworld-2018-europe-hotels.pdf)
* Travel light. You will pick up lots of swag that you will need to take back
