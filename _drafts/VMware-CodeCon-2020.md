## Introduction

With no in person events happening this year there are opportunities for new events held online. A new event on the calendar is VMware {code} Connect. What is this virtual event about? Let's have a look.

### VMware {code}

First of all, what is VMware {code}? [VMware {code}](https://code.vmware.com/home) is a collection of resources to aid the VMware developer. The site has a host of resources available on it covering APIs, SDKs, PowerCLI, Open Source, etc. If you want to interact with VMware products via code, this is the site to help you. Probably the most useful and interactive 'feature' of VMware {code} is the very active Slack channel.

You can join VMware {code} (free!) [here](https://code.vmware.com/join) and follow on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vmwarecode).

### {code} Connect 2020

VMware {code} Connect will run over two days - October 1st & 2nd from 09:00 PDT to 17:00 PDT/16:00 GMT to 00:00 GMT.

Exact details on the content seem to be scarce just now (I will update this post as more details are released) but there was the following announced:

- Keynote from VMware’s Kit Colbert, CTO Cloud Platform BU
- 30 minutes traditional Sessions
- Code on the Fly Sessions
- Script Based Competition with ControlUp
- Traditional/Automation Track– Main focus of these 30 minute sessions will include PowerShell, PowerCLI, REST API’s, etc.
- Kubernetes – If you want to deep dive into Kubernetes, this track is for you
- Partner – Come listen to sessions from our partners and community
- Hackathon!

The Code on the Fly Sessions look interesting:

> 1.5 hour sessions with SME’s where customers bring their automation questions and SME’s code solutions on the fly

So get your thinking caps on for ideas. [Kyle Ruddy](https://twitter.com/kmruddy) will be doing a Code on the Fly session on PowerCLI. Any of Kyle's content is essential viewing, so one not to miss.

### Hackathon

I participated in the Hackathon at VMworld Europe 2018 and had a blast. I learnt a lot and had a great time with my team hacking together a PowerShell module called [PowerVKE](https://github.com/PowerVKE/PowerVKE). I was worried participating I wouldn't be able to keep you with expert scripters but it was unfounded. Everyone was just there to learn something new and have a good time. Even if you do the documentation, everyone can participate in a team.

The dates to look out for are as follows:

- 7th September - Registration opens
- 20th September - Team Captains are notified of their teams
- 21st September - 2nd October - the teams work on the project
- 2nd October - Project presentations, judging and awards

When registering for the Hackathon, you will pick a topic and a country/time zone to make collaboration easier. You then have 12 days to complete the project which includes the final presentation.

I'm personally going to evaluate if I can make the time for this as I am slammed with work, but I highly recommend you give it a try.

### Wrap Up

As I mentioned above details on the sessions seem to be thin on the ground, so I will update this post as more details emerge. Keep your eyes on this page, the [{code}](https://code.vmware.com/home) homepage, and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vmwarecode) for updates. I am looking forward to this event.
