## Introduction

As I said in my previous post I recently rebuilt my computer. One of the first things I did was install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). I have used the [Settings Sync]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-09-10-Sync-Visual-Studio-Code-Settings %}) but I took the opportunity to start from scratch as I had a lot of settings and extensions that were installed on a whim. I took the time to read a few articles and cheery pick tips that were good for me.

### Extensions

These are the extensions I have installed currently:

* [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) to correct my mistypes as I go
* [Log File Highlighter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=emilast.LogFileHighlighter) which
* [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) to help format log files while troubleshooting
* [PowerShell](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.PowerShell) for PowerShell work
* [Remote - WSL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl) to integrate with WSL
* [Settings Sync](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync) to sync all these setting to GitHub
* [vscode-icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscode-icons-team.vscode-icons) to help identify file types with a glance
* [YAML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml) as I am learning Ansible which relies on YAML
