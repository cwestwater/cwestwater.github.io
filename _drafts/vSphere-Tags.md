## Introduction

I am sure I am like a lot of vSphere admins and I rely on VM Folders to organise my VM estate - typically a folder for each application. This works ok for small environments, but pretty soon it get to the point you need more information such as who created the VM, who requested it, what's the cost center, etc. Some of this information is captured in build documents, but then they turn into stale emails, knowledge in people heads, etc.

You can use the notes
