---
I sat the VCAP6-DCV Deploy exam the other day and unfortunately I failed. Here are my thoughts on the exam.

I was initially pretty annoyed I failed especially as it was by 12 points. After a couple of hours I realised I am not that upset about it (apart from having to pay the exam cost again!). Reflecting on my study strategy I was only doing what I thought I needed to pass the exam. However looking back I realise I really enjoyed learning the nuts and bolts of vSphere, especially things we are not licensed for at work. Now I will be focusing more on really **learning the technology** and not **learning the exam**. Now I know what to expect in the exam such as the style of questions I will pass it next time.

So here are my tips if you are facing the exam in no particular order are:

* The [Exam Topics](https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/plan.cfm?plan=88753&ui=www_cert) - know **EVERYTHING** forward and backwards. It really is your bible
* Time management was the hardest thing for me in the exam. If I had five more minutes this would be a different blog post! If you can do the question in less than 5 minutes do it. If not note it down on the plastic sheet with a couple of words on the question and and move onto the next one
* Know your esxli commands. I think it would be pretty hard to memorise all of them but know the main ones like the back of your hand
* Don't rely on the documentation! It's useful to have in case you blank on a command but it takes time to search and digest. If you do need it use the Advanced Search function in Adobe Reader:

* Lab the hell out of everything. This made me miss a couple of questions on vDP and vSphere Replication. I couldn't get the appliances to deploy on Workstation due to it's lack of support of OVF properties. I instead just read about them - big mistake
* Don't take the Optimize and Scale course the week before the exam like I did. It was too much information while studying at the same time
* Read the questions - there is extra information provided that is not necessary for a few questions
* 205 minutes goes very fast! I didn't pay attention to the clock as much as I should have
* If you have a [VMUG Advantage](https://www.vmug.com/VMUG-Join/VMUG-Advantage) subscription use it to get 20% off the exam

Finally some guides:

* Shout out to [Kyle Jenner](https://twitter.com/kylejenneruk) for his [VCAP6-DCV Deployment Study Guide](http://www.vjenner.com/vcap6-dcv-deployment-study-guide/)
* Thanks to [Ramy Mahmoud](https://twitter.com/RamyMahmoud) for his [Study Guide](https://goo.gl/MbJQUX)
* Know the Interface. It's based on the Hand On Labs. Read this [guide](https://mylearn.vmware.com/lcms/web/portals/certification/VMware%20Certification%20Platform%20Interface.pdf) and know how to setup the environment to maximize your real estate

It's a fair exam and didn't test me things I didn't know. If only I had managed my time better... Good luck to anyone taking it!
