## Introduction

Way back in July 2018 I wrote a [blog post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-07-22-Podcasts-July-2018 %}) on my regular list of podcasts I listen to. The list has changed so in this post I'm going to list my top 10 tech related podcasts. This covers virtualisation, storage, cloud and careers.

### Packetpushers - Various

Website: [packetpushers.net](https://packetpushers.net/)

Hosts: [Greg Ferro](https://twitter.com/etherealmind), [Ethan Banks](https://twitter.com/ecbanks), [Drew Conry-Murray](https://twitter.com/Drew_CM), [Ned Bellavance](https://twitter.com/Ned1313), and [Scott Lowe](https://twitter.com/scott_lowe)

This one is a bit of a cheat as Packet Pushers actually produce seven different shows. I personally listen to:

- [Heavy Networking](https://packetpushers.net/series/weekly-show/) - Mainly Networking technology deep dives
- [Day Two Cloud](https://packetpushers.net/series/day2cloud/) - What happens after you 'go cloud'? This podcast covers practical cloud topics
- [The Network Break](https://packetpushers.net/series/network-break-podcast-post/) - Weekly news on vendors, products and announcements
- [Full Stack Journey](https://packetpushers.net/series/full-stack-journey/) - Interviews with experts in the IT Community that are, or on the road to, becoming Full Stack Engineers

I'm in particular enjoying Day Two Cloud. It is not just covering cloud concepts but shows have included [The Tech Recruiter – Friend Or Foe?](https://packetpushers.net/podcast/day-two-cloud-088-the-tech-recruiter-friend-or-foe/), [So You Want To Be A Consultant](https://packetpushers.net/podcast/day-two-cloud-084-so-you-want-to-be-a-consultant/), [Bringing Ansible Into A Windows Shop](https://packetpushers.net/podcast/day-two-cloud-064-bringing-ansible-into-a-windows-shop/), etc.  All of the Packet Pushers episodes are well worth adding to your feed.

### VMware Communities Roundtable

Website: [VMware Communities Roundtable at Talkshoe](http://www.talkshoe.com/talkshoe/web/talkCast.jsp?masterId=19367)

Hosts: [Eric Nielsen](https://twitter.com/ericnipro) and [Matt Langguth](https://twitter.com/gsxesx)

This is a weekly podcast from VMware so naturally focusses on VMware content. vExpert announcements are usually covered on this podcast too. It's broadcast at 12:00 Pacific Time every Wednesday and has an active live chat at on the TalkShoe platform. As a bonus It's also now broadcast live on YouTube as [vBarbecue](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS1bV66Kn32Tsh8WgQ2h84w). Essential podcast if VMware is part of your role.

### Microsoft Cloud Show

Website: [www.microsoftcloudshow](http://www.microsoftcloudshow.com/)

Hosts: [Andrew Connell](https://twitter.com/andrewconnell) and [Chris Johnson](https://twitter.com/c_f_johnson)

Covering Azure and Office 365 from a developer standpoint the weekly show it's useful to keep up to date on the Microsoft cloud ecosystem. Even if you are not part of this tech community it's a good podcast to keep in the loop with Azure and a bonus of Space related chat.

### Malicious Life

Website: [Malicious Life](https://malicious.life/)

Host: [Ran Levi](https://twitter.com/ranlevi)

Cyber Security is something that should interest anyone in technology. The podcast covers hacking, viruses, exploits, breaches, crypto, etc. It's not just educational but entertaining.

### Nerd Journey Podcast

Website: [nerd-journey.com](http://nerd-journey.com/)

Hosts: [Nick Korte](https://twitter.com/NetworkNerd_) and [John White](https://twitter.com/vJourneyman)

John and Nick cover IT career advice, work/life balance, resumes, and other topics. Usually in the form of an interview the guest they have got to speak are excellent. New episodes usually jump right to the top of my playlist. This had only just started back in 2018 but the podcast has become one of my favourites.

### Nerd Herd Podcast

Website: [netdherdpodcast.com](https://nerdherdpodcast.com/)

Hosts: [Greg Knieriemen](https://twitter.com/Knieriemen), [Sarah Vela](https://twitter.com/Orchid8), [Amy Lewis](https://twitter.com/commsninja), [Ed Saipetch](https://twitter.com/edsai)

The band got back together! The previous hosts of [Speaking in Tech](https://twitter.com/speakingintech) have come back to start a new podcast. It's like listening to a bunch of friends talk about technology topics such as EV's, technology giants, app of the week and many other topics. It is now recorded using Clubhouse so if you have the app you can participate in the podcast.

### Virtually Speaking Podcast

Website: [www.vspeakingpodcast.com](http://www.vspeakingpodcast.com/)

Hosts: [Pete Flecha](https://twitter.com/vpedroarrow) and [John Nicholson](https://twitter.com/lost_signal)

Focusing on storage and availability in the vSphere realm featuring great guests such as William Lam, Frank Denneman, Duncan Epping, etc. Another essential listen if you are involved in any way with VMware products.

### Software Defined Talk

Website: [Software Defined Talk](https://www.softwaredefinedtalk.com/)

Hosts: [Brandon Whichard](https://twitter.com/bwhichard), [Michael Coté](https://twitter.com/cote) and [Matt Ray](https://twitter.com/mattray)

This podcast talks about enterprise software, cloud, Kubernetes, serverless, etc. I always learn something new from this podcast and I really enjoy the banter between the hosts.

### RunAsRadio

Website: [runasradion.com](http://runasradio.com/)

Hosts: [Richard Campbell](https://twitter.com/RichCampbell)

A podcast with a Microsoft-centric viewpoint. Covers Azure, Security, SQL, Office 365, etc. I enjoyed the pandemic series of shows over 2020 into 2021 which had plenty of interesting topics during the crazy times of 2020. RunAsRadio has close to 800 shows published this is another high quality show with excellent guests.

### Tech ONTAP Podcast

Website: [Tech ONTAP Podcast](https://community.netapp.com/t5/Tech-ONTAP-Podcast-Episodes/bg-p/techontap)

Host: [Justin Parisi](https://twitter.com/NFSDudeAbides)

I've recently started using NetApp ONTAP clusters and so wanted to broaden my knowledge of the systems around it. Subscribe if you use NetApp products and want to be kept informed of what is happening at NetApp.

## Wrap Up

Some familiar podcasts from the previous post, but sadly some have just dropped off and either have retired or post so infrequently it's a nice surprise to see an episode pop up in my player. I have found some great new podcasts to make up for it.
