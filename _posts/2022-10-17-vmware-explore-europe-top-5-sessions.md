## Introduction

In a [recent post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2022-08-02-vmware-explore-2022-top-10-sessions %}), I detailed the VMware Explore US 2022 Content Catalog and picked out the top 10 sessions I would attend.

This post is specific to the top 5 VMware Explore Europe sessions breakout sessions I have picked out. For each session I detail a link to the session, the speaker(s), the excerpt and finally why I would see that session.

You have invested a lot of money, time and energy into your vSphere environment, so why wouldn't you want it to perform to the best it could? This session looks like it can give you recommendations to get the best performance, but also troubleshoot when you are having performance issues. I will 100% be watching is session back.

### Project Monterey Behind the Scenes: A Technical Deep Dive [CEIB1576EUR]

Content Catalog Link: [CEIB1576EUR](https://event.vmware.com/flow/vmware/explore2022eu/content/page/catalog?search=CEIB1576EUR&tab.contentcatalogtabs=1627421929827001vRXW)

Excerpt:

> In this session, we will explore how Project Monterey offloads traffic to the data processing unit (DPU), allowing for additional workload resources, Zero Trust security, as well as enhanced performance. But what goes on behind the scenes that allows Project Monterey to be so good at enhanced performance? Is it just adding a DPU? Join this session to find the answer and more technical nuggets to help you see the power of DPUs with Project Monterey.

DPUs are an exciting development in the vSphere ecosystem. Basically ESXi can offload work such as NSX firewalling, security scanning, etc away from the host CPU to free up resources for your workloads. Like all innovations it seems like it might not be relevant to you but I can see DPUs becoming common in servers in the future. Get ahead of the curve and learn about DPUs in this session.

Excerpt:

> Hyperconverged Infrastructure (HCI) powered by VMware vSAN 8 with vSAN Express Storage Architecture enhances performance, efficiency, data protection, and management of vSAN running on the latest NVMe storage devices. You will get a detailed explanation of the features and benefits of vSAN’s next-generation architecture that delivers lower TCO, improved space efficiency, RAID-5/6 at the performance of RAID-1, higher availability, and better data protection with native snapshots.

vSAN has come a long way since it was released. I think it's fair to say it had some growing pains, but is now a stable, performant, and useful storage platform. More features are added with each release and vSAN 8 is a big one. In particular the vSAN Express Storage Architecture is a leap in the capabilities of vSAN. Part of ESA is getting RAID5/6 space efficiency with RAID1 performance. Amazing!

### vSphere+: Bringing Cloud Benefits to On-Premises [CEIB1820EUR]
