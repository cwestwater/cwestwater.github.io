Coming up in a week is a [Scottish VMUG](http://vmug.com/scotland) meeting scheduled for 26th October 2017. As usual the VMUG Leaders have secured some amazing speakers for an event I am very much looking forward to attending.

They have convinced (or in one case bribed with whisky) no less than three VCDX's to speak. First up we welcome back to Scotland [Duncan Epping](http://twitter.com/duncanyb). As long time reader of his [blog](http://www.yellow-bricks.com) and an owner of several of his books I am looking forward to his presentation.

Second is [Rawlinson Rivera](https://twitter.com/punchingclouds) who's blog I also follow. He is coming as a representative of [Cohesity](http://www.cohesity.com/) where he will introduce us to the Cohesity product.

Finally there is [Chris Wahl](https://twitter.com/chriswahl). I am a big fan as he has such a great [blog](http://wahlnetwork.com/), [podcast](http://packetpushers.net/series/datanauts-podcast/) and I found his book [Networking for VMware Administrators](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Networking-VMware-Administrators-Press-Technology-ebook/dp/B00J4N8TTS/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1508094739&sr=8-1-fkmr0) extremely helpful. I see him as the role model Full Stack Engineer and his talk to us will be titled "My Journey to Full Stack Engineering". Pretty much a must attend event.

There are some other great sessions from the sponsors:
* Asystec - A Real-life example of a customer’s Digital Transformation Journey with Elavon Financial Services
* Softcat - Insider Threat: Building a zero trust infrastructure

Of course there are a number of VMware sessions:
* Clive Wenman - VMware Cloud Foundation – the Path to VMware Cloud
* Nicolas Vibert - Advanced Programmability and Cloud Security with NSX
* Darren Hirons - Is desktop security still making you ‘wannacry’? 
* Lee Dilworth - vSAN 6.6.1 “deep dive”
* Robbie Jerrom - VMware PKS and Containers

Shout out to community member [Steven Soave](http://twitter.com/stevensoave) who answered the call and volunteered to do a talk on IBM Spectrum Protect for Virtual Environments.

Also there is a community session from [Katarina Wagnerova](https://twitter.com/_KatkaW_) called #Katatsea: Delivering IT on a boat which should be very interesting.

Finally at the end of the day there will be vBeers sponsored by [IGEL](https://www.igel.com). I hope to catch up with some of the people I met at the last vBeers.

See below the full agenda with timings.
