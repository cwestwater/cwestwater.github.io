PowerCLI is such an awesome tool. Based on PowerShell the functionality has increased with each release. Watch out for some upcoming blog posts on PowerCLI.  One script I wrote recently uses PowerCLI to generate a Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) Gold image for capturing.  I was doing this manually each month (when I remembered) but using PowerCLI I have the process automated.

Seriously, if you are a VMware admin you need to learn PowerCLI.

PowerCLI 6.5 R1 was released a while back, and then just this week a great poster was released updated for this version.  You can grab it [here](https://blogs.vmware.com/PowerCLI/2017/02/powercli-65-poster.html). The poster has a cmdlet list and some helpful hints.

Incidentally VMware have other posters available.  They can be accessed using the shortcut [VMware Posters](http://vmware.com/go/posters/)

My only comment about the posters is they are sized for US poster printing.  If anyone has found a UK based one off poster printer that can handle US sized paper it would be appreciated.  Just now I am printing on A1 and cutting down to size.
