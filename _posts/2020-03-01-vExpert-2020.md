It's that time of year again where the vExpert announcement has been awarded and I'm very honoured to be made a vExpert 2020. This is the fourth year as a vExpert and I'm still excited about it.

The definition of the [vExpert program](https://vexpert.vmware.com/) is:

> The VMware vExpert program is VMware's global evangelism and advocacy program. The program is designed to put VMware's marketing resources towards your advocacy efforts. Promotion of your articles, exposure at our global events, co-op advertising, traffic analysis, and early access to beta programs and VMware's roadmap. The awards are for individuals, not companies, and last for one year. Employees of both customers and partners can receive the awards.

Special thanks to [Corey Romero](https://twitter.com/vcommunityguy) at VMware and all the [vExpert PROs](https://blogs.vmware.com/vexpert/2018/10/10/vmware-vexpert-pro-program-launch/) that helped with the voting.

If you want to know more about the vExpert program reach out to one of the PROs who can advise and how to get vExpert status.
