With the latest version of the VMware MyLearn website they removed the PDF versions of the blueprints for exams. I found those very helpful when studying for my VCP 5 as I could tick off what I had revised.

At the last Scottish VMUG there was a talk by [Jason Dinsdale](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasondinsdale), EMEA Education Delivery Manager at VMware and he hinted they will be back.

As I am studying for the VCP 6 Delta Exam, I created a PDF version of the online blueprint.

You can grab it [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/pdf/2V0-621D.pdf).

Hopefully someone out there will find it helpful!
