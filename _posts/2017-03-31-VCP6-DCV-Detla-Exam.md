Just a quick post.  I passed the VCP6-DCV Delta exam today.  The three study guides I used were:

* [@coolsport00](https://twitter.com/coolsport00) aka Shane Williford had the guide I used the most.  It condenses all the knowledge into less than sixty pages.  Make sure you get it [here](http://vbrownbag.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/VCP6-Study-Guide.pdf)
* [@jaslanger](https://twitter.com/jaslanger) (Jason Langer) and [@joshcoen](https://twitter.com/joshcoen) (Josh Coen) have a great guide [here](http://virtuallanger.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/vcp6-dcv_sg.pdf).  So detailed and helpful.  I used their previous guide to pass the VCP5 so amazing job guys!
* [@Vladan](https://twitter.com/vladan) also has a very comprehensive guide [here](http://demand.simplivity.com/study-guide-2016-vcp6-dcv?utm_source=vladan&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=VCP6-study-guide).  Well worth a download.

Next up the VCAP6-DCV Deploy after a wee holiday.
