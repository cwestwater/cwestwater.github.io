Coming up soon is the fourth [Scottish PowerShell & DevOps User Group](https://twitter.com/ScotPSUG) meeting scheduled for the 22nd August 2017. I want to say big thanks to Paul Broadwith ([@pauby](https://twitter.com/pauby/)) for getting this off the ground. If it wasn't for people like him nothing would happen or it would all be driven by vendors.

I have a healthy interest in PowerShell (and PowerCLI) so this is ideal for me to learn from people that I consider true experts. Already Paul has given talks on PowerShell best practices that was very interesting and gave me food for thought. There is talk of setting up a beginners track for newbies like me. At the last meeting I did a presentation on the excellent [Learn Windows PowerShell in a Month of Lunches](https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Books/Learn-Windows-Powershell-Month-Lunches-Donald-Jones/1617294160/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1501790291&sr=8-1&keywords=1617294160) by Don Jones and Jeff Hicks. All the meetups so far have been recorded and should be online soon.

So far all the meetups have been online, but I know Paul is keen to do a face to face meeting soon. A website is in the works too.

As with most other meetups Paul needs people to speak up and talk about PowerShell.  He's talked each time and I have presented. Time to step up people!
