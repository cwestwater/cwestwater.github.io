Coming up soon is the second [Glasgow Azure User Group](http://www.gaug.co.uk/) meeting [scheduled for the 23rd August 2017](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/glasgow-azure-user-group-meetup-2-tickets-35031884309?aff=twitter). The first was an introduction to see if there was any interest, so this is the first with some content. First of all thanks to Sarah Lean ([@TechieLass](https://twitter.com/TechieLass)) for kicking this off. If it wasn't for people like her nothing would happen or it would all be driven by vendors.

Now I am a cloud novice. At work we use Office 365 and that is as far as we are on our cloud journey. As a Microsoft shop I am pretty confident Azure will be in our future. Even if it's not I always want to be learning something new, so attending will be useful no matter what.

Unfortunately all tickets have been taken, but there is a waitlist. Contact Sarah to get on it. The two topics that will be covered are:
* Basics of the Azure platform
* Serverless in Azure

Obviously I am looking forward to the basics talk.

There will be two more meetups this year on the 23rd August and one in December. If you are interested follow GAUG on its [website](http://www.gaug.co.uk/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GlasgowAzureUG), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/GlasgowAzureUG/) or sign up for the [newsletter](http://gaug.us15.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=8fa0b1f660ecc804c95be0d7e&id=4f0384718a).

Hope to see some of you there. Make sure you say hello!
