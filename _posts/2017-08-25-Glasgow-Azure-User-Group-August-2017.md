excerpt: "Recap of the August 2017 Glasgow Azure Users Group Meeting"
---
On Wednesday 23rd August 2017 the second [Glasgow Azure Users Group](http://www.gaug.co.uk/) meeting organised by [Sarah Lean](https://twitter.com/TechieLass) and [Tom Cox](https://twitter.com/Koxzi95) happened. It was a great start to the user group.

My Azure knowledge is near zero. I know it's on my horizon at work, so I am keen to learn about it. I attended knowing the first half would be for beginners, and the second half was about serverless in Azure.

Obviously I was very keen to hear from Dave Samuelson (Microsoft Cloud Solution Architect) on the basics of Azure. He asked the room who was familiar with Azure already and everyone apart from me and one other person out their hand up. However I think people familiar with Azure got something from the talk.  Dave covered the Azure data centers, regions, the Azure Resource Manager, Azure CLI, PowerShell, and eventually spinning up some VM's, functions, Twitter and PowerBI to show what can be done very quickly. I found it useful to see Azure in the flesh and what it can do seemingly pretty easily.

Finally he recommended just diving in. He told us that you can get a free $200 credit and 30 days of usage for free at this [link](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/free/). You do need to put in a credit card, but it will not be charged. I fully intend to take advantage of this.

There was then free beers and pizza courtesy of [Hays Recruitment](https://www.hays.co.uk/) who also provided the venue. Thanks Kenny and Justin! It was great to chat to [John Gallacher](https://twitter.com/jongalac) where we talked VMware, PowerShell, careers, community and missed opportunities.
