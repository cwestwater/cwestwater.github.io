excerpt: "I presented a vBrownBag session on using vSphere with Terraform"
---
On the 19th December 2017 I presented a session on [vBrownbag](https://vbrownbag.com/) titled Using Terraform with vSphere. It's now available on the [vBrownBag YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQ7oRSi6mBU).

[Rebbeca Fitzhugh](https://twitter.com/RebeccaFitzhugh) reached out to me and asked if I would do a session after she read my [Terraform Series]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-10-01-Terraform-Part-1 %}). Of course I jumped at the chance.

In the session I cover:

* Terraform Terminology
* Installation
* Initialisation
* Creating a new VM
* Cloning a VM
* Variables and the associated files
* Documentation

It's pretty much all live demo and I show how easy it is to get started with Terrform to spin up or clone VM's. I have posted the code I used on my [GitHub](https://github.com/cwestwater/Terraform/tree/master/vBrownbag). This should be the first of a series on Terraform so watch out for more.

I want thank the vBrownBag team for the opportunity to present. I love the content they produce and to be asked to participate was an amazing opportunity.
