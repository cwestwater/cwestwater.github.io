I am extremely excited and honoured to be confirmed as a vExpert for 2018. This is the second year in a row I have been awarded it.

The vExpert program overview is defined:

> The annual VMware vExpert award is given to individuals who have significantly contributed to the community of VMware users over the past year. The title is awarded to individuals (not employers) for their commitment to sharing their knowledge and passion for VMware technology above and beyond their job requirements.

I want to say thanks to [Corey Romero](https://twitter.com/vcommunityguy) and the team at VMware for all the hard work they put into the vExpert program.

If you are a new vExpert reach out to [Ariel Sanchez Mora](https://twitter.com/arielsanchezmor) and he can send you a valuable guide on making the most of being a vExpert.
