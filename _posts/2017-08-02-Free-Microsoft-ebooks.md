For the last few years Microsoft have published a list of free eBooks and PDF's that I have occasionally looked at. A saw on a blog post a few weeks back that it had been updated and thought I would put up a post about it. I am not sure that many people realise it's there.

The list includes such categories as:
* Azure
* BizTalk
* Cloud
* Developer
* Dynamics
* General
* Licensing
* Office
* PowerBI
* PowerShell
* SharePoint
* SQL Server
* Surface
* System Center
* Virtualization
* Windows Client
* Windows Server

In total there are over 300 titles available. There are some great titles such as "Introducing Windows Azure for IT Professionals", a range of Office Quick Start Guides, "Introducing Microsoft PowerBI", "Introducing Windows Server 2016", etc. Some titles are close to 200 pages, some are a one page reference sheet.

I guarantee if you are an IT Pro using Microsoft products you will find something useful here. Even more helpful there is a PowerShell script at the bottom of the page to do a mass download of all the titles.
