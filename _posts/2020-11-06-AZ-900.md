## Introduction

I passed the [AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900) exam today to earn the [Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-fundamentals) certification.

## Study Material

The key to this exam is the exam skills outline which details everything you may be tested on. This can be downloaded from the [AZ-900](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900) page under the skills measured section:

In the end I used a combination of free and paid resources to gain the knowledge to pass. The free content was:

- [Skylines Academy](https://www.skylinesacademy.com/blog/2020/10/11/az-900-microsoft-azure-fundamentals-course-free) made their excellent AZ-900 course free last month. Nick is a great trainer and this is highly recommended
- [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/az-900-describe-cloud-concepts/) have a recently updated learning path for AZ-900. Read more about Microsoft Learn in a [previous post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-03-30-Microsoft-Learn %})
- [Thomas Maurer](https://www.thomasmaurer.ch/2020/03/az-900-study-guide-microsoft-azure-fundamentals-2020/) has a great post with links to content for each section of the blueprint. I used this a lot to focus in on the correct Microsoft documentation
- [Taygan Rifat](https://www.taygan.co/blog/2019/02/07/az-900-azure-fundamentals-exam-preparation) has a very concise list of the main highlights for each topic. Great for skimming along the essentials

As for the paid for content I have access to Pluralsight so I also ran through their [learning path](https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/microsoft-azure-fundamentals-az-900). It went into lots of detail about the material but as usual with Pluralsight content was of very high calibre.

I probably did more studying I needed to pass, but this will help me for future Azure certifications.

## Free Azure Account

Now watching and reading is great, but you also need to get hands on with Azure. All you need is an email address and no credit card commitment to get the following:

- £150 of Azure credit (time limited to 30 days)
- 12 months of popular free services
- Always free access to 25+ services

Free tip - if the £150 credit in 30 days expires, but register again with a different email address! You can [sign up here](<(https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/free/)>) for your free account.

## Bonus Tip - Free AZ-900 Exam Voucher
