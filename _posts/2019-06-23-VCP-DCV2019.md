# Introduction

In early June 2019 I sat and passed VMware Exam 2V0-622 to obtain the certification VMware Certified Professional - Data Center Virtualization 2019.

## The Exam

This is my third VCP and was the toughest yet. Let just say I studied just over enough for the exam! I had originally booked it for March a week before my VCP expired but then VMware dropped the [recertification policy](https://blogs.vmware.com/education/2019/02/04/vmware-certification-recertification-is-changing-and-what-it-means-to-you/) the night after I booked the exam.

I am glad they did as work was so hectic I just never found the time to study. Eventually after rescheduling the exam three times I knew I had to knuckle down. To study for the exam I used lots of resources. See my earlier post on the material I used:

Many thanks to all the amazing people out there that contribute back by producing this material to help the community. It's greatly appreciated.

My tips for the exam:

* Know the new features of 6.5 such as vCenter HA, VMFS6, etc.
* Make sure you understand vSAN
* For the first time I kicked myself I didn't read the configuration maxims enough
* You have plenty of time - I was done in an hour. Make sure you mark anything you are unsure of and if stuck eliminate as many choices as possible and stick with your gut choice
* Know the Blueprint inside out
* Lab as much as you can, especially things like VDP that you may not use in the 'real world'

## What's Next

The big question! I really want another crack at the VCAP Deploy and feel I could pass it with some study time and now I have experience of the time crunch. The thing there are so many other things I want to try. High on my list is VCP-CMA as there is talk of vRealize Suite coming to work and of course there is cloud. I have no cloud experience so I feel I need to get on that track too.

Any opinions or advise please weigh in.

## Wrap Up

Another Exam, another win. I know certifications are not for everyone but I feel it is a good validation of your skills and a great feeling when you pass.
