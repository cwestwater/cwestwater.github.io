[Matt Heldstab](https://twitter.com/mattheldstab) proposed Blogtober for virtualisation community and I have decided to participate. At this point there are 38 people signed up with a mixture of old and new blogs.

What is Blogtober? Basically it a reason to get people to blog more. The rule is simple - post five articles in October. That is it! Simple. I am pretty much posting once a week but this may give this blog more exposure and it will up my post count for the month. It also gives me a reason to follow up on a series I have been thinking about for a while.

I feel I want/need to post more technical content so by participating in this with amazing people from the community such as [Rebecca Fitzhugh](https://twitter.com/RebeccaFitzhugh), [Paul Braren](https://www.twitter.com/paulbraren), [Tim Davis](https://www.twitter.com/ALDTD), [Paul Woodward Jr.](https://www.twitter.com/explorevm), it will prompt me to work on the content.

It's not too late to participate. Go to the website [Blogtober](http://www.blogtober.net) and post in the comments of the page to be added to the blogroll.

I look forward to reading the posts!
