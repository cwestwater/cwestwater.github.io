# Introduction

I am currently rebuilding my lab as it was time to refresh it. I run it all nested on [VMware Workstation 15](https://www.vmware.com/uk/products/workstation-pro.html) as I have a powerful enough PC to run a nested three host cluster easily. Deploying the ESXi and VCSA OVAs is very easy in v15 so a single PC has more WAF than a bunch of server class machines.

As part of the lab I run nested vSAN which obviously is not on the [vSAN HCL](https://www.vmware.com/resources/compatibility/search.php?deviceCategory=vsan) so when the lab was built vSAN was showing a Health warning `SCSI controller is VMware Certified` which left an Alarm on the cluster which tweaked my OCD.

![vSAN Health Warning]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vSAN-Health-Warning.png)

As it's a nested lab it would never pass this health check so I wanted to disable it. Using the Ruby vSphere Console (RVC) it is possible to disable any of the health checks. In this blog I will go through the procedure for cleaning up this warning in my cluster.

This is all based on vSAN version 6.6.1. In my vCenter the Datacenter is called `Contoso` and the Cluster `Corp`.

## Ruby vSphere Console

The RVC is a command line tool in the VCSA that is another CLI tool for managing vSphere. RVC is one of the main tools for managing and troubleshooting a vSAN environment.

There are a few guides on using the RVC but one I have used is a series of posts on the vSphere blog written by [Joe Cook](https://twitter.com/CloudAnimal):

* [Part 1 - Introduction to the Ruby vSphere Console](https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2014/07/managing-vsan-ruby-vsphere-console.html)
* [Part 2 - Navigating your vSphere and Virtual SAN infrastructure with RVC](https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2014/08/managing-virtual-san-rvc-part-2-navigating-vsphere-virtual-san-infrastructure-rvc.html)
* [Part 3 â€“ RVC Usage and Command Syntax](https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2014/08/blog3-managing-virtual-san-rvc-part-3-rvc-usage-command-syntax.html)

It's a few years old but a useful starting point for the RVC. Joe along with [Cormac Hogan](https://twitter.com/CormacJHogan) also produced the [VMware Ruby vSphere Console Command Reference for Virtual SAN](https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/digitalmarketing/vmware/en/pdf/products/vsan/vmware-ruby-vsphere-console-command-reference-for-virtual-san.pdf). Again it's a few years old but a useful resource.

To log into the RVC ssh into the VCSA and type `rvc`. You will be prompted for credentials which relies on the PSC SSO for validation. In this case I am going to use the `administrator@vsphere.local` username and as I am connected to the VCSA I want to work on I specify the `localhost`:

~~~ bash
login as: root
Pre-authentication banner message from server:
|
| VMware vCenter Server Appliance 6.5.0.20000
|
| Type: vCenter Server with an embedded Platform Services Controller
|
End of banner message from server
Keyboard-interactive authentication prompts from server:
| Password:
End of keyboard-interactive prompts from server
Last login: Sat Apr 13 21:09:53 2019 from 10.10.1.11
Connected to service

    * List APIs: "help api list"
    * List Plugins: "help pi list"
    * Launch BASH: "shell"

Command> srvc
Install the "ffi" gem for better tab completion.
Host to connect to (user@host): administrator@vsphere.local@localhost
password:
0 /
1 localhost/
>
~~~

We are now in the RVC.

## RVC Navigation

In RVC vSphere and vSAN are navigated like a file system using `ls` and `cd` commands. Think of this like PowerShell. In PowerShell you can navigate the Registry like a file system. In RVC vSphere is shown in the vCenter hierarchy:

~~~ bash
> ls
0 /
1 localhost/
> cd localhost/
/localhost> ls
0 Contoso (datacenter)
/localhost> cd Contoso
/localhost/Contoso> cd /
> ls
0 /
1 localhost/
> cd localhost
/localhost> ls
0 Contoso (datacenter)
/localhost> cd Contoso
/localhost/Contoso> ls
0 storage/
1 computers [host]/
2 networks [network]/
3 datastores [datastore]/
4 vms [vm]/
~~~

You can then browse down into things like the Cluster, vDSs, vSAN, etc.

In this example I browse down to a host and into the vSAN datastore on that host using the usual `cd` and `ls` commands:

~~~ bash
> ls
0 /
1 localhost/
> cd localhost
/localhost> ls
0 Contoso (datacenter)
/localhost> cd Contoso
/localhost/Contoso> ls
0 storage/
1 computers [host]/
2 networks [network]/
3 datastores [datastore]/
4 vms [vm]/
/localhost/Contoso> cd computers
/localhost/Contoso/computers> ls
0 Corp (cluster): cpu 10 GHz, memory 7 GB
/localhost/Contoso/computers> cd Corp
/localhost/Contoso/computers/Corp> ls
0 hosts/
1 resourcePool [Resources]: cpu 10.60/10.60/normal, mem 7.07/7.07/normal
/localhost/Contoso/computers/Corp> cd hosts
/localhost/Contoso/computers/Corp/hosts> ls
0 esxi1.corp.contoso.com (host): cpu 2*1*3.50 GHz, memory 10.00 GB
1 esxi2.corp.contoso.com (host): cpu 2*1*3.50 GHz, memory 10.00 GB
2 esxi3.corp.contoso.com (host): cpu 2*1*3.50 GHz, memory 10.00 GB
/localhost/Contoso/computers/Corp/hosts> cd esxi1.corp.contoso.com
/localhost/Contoso/computers/Corp/hosts/esxi1.corp.contoso.com> ls
0 vms/
1 datastores/
2 networks/
/localhost/Contoso/computers/Corp/hosts/esxi1.corp.contoso.com> cd datastores
/localhost/Contoso/computers/Corp/hosts/esxi1.corp.contoso.com/datastores> ls
0 vsanDatastore: 96.61GB 2.0%
/localhost/Contoso/computers/Corp/hosts/esxi1.corp.contoso.com/datastores> cd vsanDatastore
/localhost/Contoso/computers/Corp/hosts/esxi1.corp.contoso.com/datastores/vsanDatastore> ls
0 files
1 vms/
2 hosts/
3 capabilitysets/
~~~

To speed up navigation when you type `ls` there is a number beside each entry. You can simply type `cd` and the number. For example:

~~~ bash
/localhost/Contoso> ls
0 storage/
1 computers [host]/
2 networks [network]/
3 datastores [datastore]/
4 vms [vm]/
/localhost/Contoso> cd 1
/localhost/Contoso/computers>
~~~

## Disabling the vSAN Health Alarm

vSAN Health Checks are performed at the Cluster level which in RVC is at `/localhost/Contoso/computers/Corp`. We can check the Cluster vSAN health by running the command `vsan.health.health_summary` with the cluster appended:

~~~ bash
> vsan.health.health_summary /localhost/Contoso/computers/Corp
Overall health: red (vSAN HCL warning)

You can see the warning under the Hardware Compatibility section.

Each health check item has a particular ID associated with it which is then used with the `vsan.health.silent_check_configure` command to disable it.

First to get the ID of the check to disable use the command `vsan.health.silent_health_check_status`:

~~~ bash

The one we want to disable is `controlleronhcl`. We can then use the `vsan.health.silent_health_check_configure` command with the cluster `/localhost/Contoso/computers/Corp` and the switch `--add-checks 'controlleronhcl'`:

~~~ bash
> vsan.health.silent_health_check_configure /localhost/Contoso/computers/Corp --add-checks 'controlleronhcl'
Successfully add check "SCSI controller is VMware certified" to silent health check list for Corp
~~~

If we then run a Health check we can see that the HCL check is skipped:

~~~ bash
> vsan.health.health_summary /localhost/Contoso/computers/Corp
Overall health: green (OK)
+-----------------------------------------+---------+
| Health check                            | Result  |
+-----------------------------------------+---------+
|   SCSI controller is VMware certified   | skipped |
+-----------------------------------------+---------+
~~~

You can see the overall health is now green, and in the GUI:

![vSAN Health Skipped]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/vSAN-Health-Skipped.png)

## Wrap Up

Now that check is skipped the warning is gone from my Cluster and my OCD is happy.

The RVC seems to be a useful tool for checking and manipulating vSphere and vSAN so I am going to spend some more time investigating what can be done with it.

I hope this post helps others that run a nested vSAN lab.
