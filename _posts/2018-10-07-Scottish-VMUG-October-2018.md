# Introduction

On Thursday 4th October 2018 the second Scottish VMUG for 2018 took place in Edinburgh. It was a brilliant event with some great news and some news in changes to the group leadership.

## Sessions

There was a great variety of sessions during the day. The big coup of the day was having [Chad Sakac](https://twitter.com/sakacc) as the Keynote speaker. I started taking notes of the talk but it was so engaging I just gave up! It was an interesting format  where Chad presented 20 images to talk about, with each image lasting 20 seconds.

Then he used a [socratic method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method) to involve us the audience in the session. He really knew how to get us involved in the discussion. It was a great session from Chad. Kudos to the leadership in getting Chad to visit us in Scotland.

Next I attended a session on [VeloCloud](http://www.velocloud.com/). This SD-WAN solution seems to be very sophisticated. A range of hardware and virtual appliances, Dynamic multi-path optimisation, zero-touch provisioning, orchestration, SaaS and cloud awareness, application optimisation, etc. make this a feature rich solution.

Zerto gave an update on their solution. It seems they have a total package now for data protection. Backup and DR are becoming one thing. Zerto are well known for VM replication but now with a new version of their software they offer long term backup retention. Zerto say they can now offer backup, replication, orchestration and migration.

## Coommunity Session

The Coommunity session was from VMUG member [Allan McAleavy](https://twitter.com/Al_unix) who is a performance engineer at Sky. His session was on using vROPS and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) to help find noisy neighbour VMs. I have seen a few posts about Grafna recently so I was interested to see what Allan would cover.

Allan knows his stuff. Grafana seems to get a really useful solution to drill down into your environment and find the nuggets of information that can help you diagnose what is causing your problems. I intend to look into what I can do with it.

I also want to give special thanks to Allan. After his session I asked him about some badly performing VMs I am troubleshooting at work. He spent time with me going through the things I should be looking for in great depth and then made notes of it all and emailed it to me.  Thanks!!

## VMUG Update

After Chad's session we were told of a change of VMUG leadership. As [Chris Storrie](https://twitter.com/chrisstorrie) now works for VMware, he is stepping down from the Leadership Team. Congratulations to [Martin Campbell](https://twitter.com/vmartincam) who is taking Chris's place.

## Coommunity Member of the Year

Unknown to me Chris started talking about awarding a Scottish VMUG Community Member of the Year. Little did I know he was talking about me!

I cannot express my thanks enough to Chris, Sandy, Iain and James for the ticket to VMworld Europe. It's an amazing gesture and opportunity I fully intend to take advantage of. Look out VMworld, here I come.

At the vBeers I had great conversations about studying for certifications, burnout, mental health, driving fast cars, dumb things people do in IT, meditation, Linux, and many other topics. Great conversations with great people. I tried to convince people to participate more by contributing to the [Community Blog](http://www.scottishvmug.com/) or doing a community session. There was a great idea floated to help people in the community so I hope we can get it off the ground.

Lastly I finally got to meet [Rebecca Fitzhugh](https://twitter.com/RebeccaFitzhugh) and thank her for all the opportunities she's given me. Looking forward to seeing her at VMworld in November.

## Wrap Up

There is going to be a vBeers event in Glasgow on the 18th January 2019 with the next VMUG scheduled for 21st March. I am looking forward to it already. Hope to see you there.
