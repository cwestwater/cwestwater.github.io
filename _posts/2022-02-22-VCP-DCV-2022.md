## Introduction

Today I sat and passed [VMware Exam 2V0-21.20](https://www.vmware.com/learning/certification/vcp-dcv-7-exam.html) to obtain the certification VMware Certified Professional - Data Center Virtualization 2022.

In this post I'll list the resources I used to study for the exam to help you on your journey to this certification.

### VMware Study Material

When studying for any certification the first thing you should always look at is the [Exam Blueprint](https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/digitalmarketing/vmware/en/pdf/certification/vmw-vcp-dcv-exam-preparation-guide.pdf). This details all the topics you need to study that could appear in the exam. Work through all the sections in this.

> What I did find confusing is in the outline there are sections such as Section 3 - Planning and Designing - There are no testable objectives for this section. Why list them if they are not testable?

A valuable recourse often overlooked is the [VMware Documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/index.html). I find the VMware docs very high quality and they are well worth reading through, even outside of a certification attempt.

You can study for the exam just by reading, but you should also be trying out each thing you learn in a lab environment. If you don't have access to one think about using the [VMware Hands-on Labs](https://hol.vmware.com/). There is nothing stopping you starting a HoL session and just using the environment for study.

### Pluralsight Learning Paths

If you have access to Pluralsight, there are two excellent paths available.

The Learning Path [Implementing and Managing VMware vSphere 7](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/skills/implementing-and-managing-vmware-vsphere) by [David Davis](https://twitter.com/davidmdavis) is a great series of videos that I'd equate to the official VMware course [VMware vSphere: Install, Configure, Manage [V7]](https://mylearn.vmware.com/mgrReg/courses.cfm?ui=www_edu&a=one&id_subject=93058). Even though I have completed the offical course I watched these to see what new features were in vSphere 7.

The Certification Path [VCP-DCV 2021: VMware Certified Professional - Data Center Virtualization (2V0-21.20)](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/certificate/vcp-dcv-2021-vmware-certified-professional-data-center-virtualization-2v0-2120) by [Matt Allford](https://twitter.com/mattallford) and [Ryan Shultz](https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/author/ryan-shultz) is a set of videos that specifically tracks the exam topics listed in the Exam Blueprint. If you want to watch training that targets the exam topics these are extremely helpful videos to watch.

### Community Study Guides

Every time I've studied for a VCP exam [Shane Williford](https://twitter.com/coolsport00) has been my first port of call. Once again he produced an outstanding [Study Guide](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hzf3mhovvmic014/vcpdcv2021-study-guide.pdf?dl=0). The amount of work that must have got into this guide is crazy and I appreciate his work so much. Thanks Shane!

[Mike Wilson](https://twitter.com/IT_Muscle) created a [Study Guide](https://www.it-muscle.com/vcp-dcv-2020-vsphere-7-study-guide-complete-pdf/) for VCP-DCV 2020 but 99% of the content is applicable to the 2021 and 2022 versions of the exam. Again thanks to Mike for all the hard work.

## Wrap Up

I really enjoyed the exam and managed to pass with a score of 484/500 - my best yet.  If you use the resources in this guide you can pass too. Good luck!
