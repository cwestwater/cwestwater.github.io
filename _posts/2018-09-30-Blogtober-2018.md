# Introduction

Last year [Matt Heldstab](https://twitter.com/mattheldstab) organised a blogging event called Blogtober Tech Edition 2017. It was a great way for people to blog more and drive some more viewers to their site. I really enjoyed it last year and it led to some other amazing opportunities.

Well it is back for 2018! The details can be accessed at [blogtober.net](http://blogtober.net).

## Blogtober 2017

In 2017 I posted eight posts in October 2017. These were:

* [Terraform with vSphere - Part 1](https://www.vgemba.net/vmware/terraform/Terraform-Part-1/)
* [Terraform with vSphere - Part 2](https://www.vgemba.net/vmware/terraform/Terraform-Part-2/)
* [Terraform with vSphere - Part 3](https://www.vgemba.net/vmware/terraform/Terraform-Part-3/)
* [Terraform with vSphere - Part 4](https://www.vgemba.net/vmware/terraform/Terraform-Part-4/)
* [Upcoming Scottish VMUG - 26th October 2017](https://www.vgemba.net/vmug/vmware/Upcoming-Scottish-VMUG-October-2017/)
* [Windows 10 Fall Creators Update and Synology NAS](https://www.vgemba.net/microsoft/Windows-10-Synology-SMB1-Error/)
* [Scottish VMUG - 26th October 2017](https://www.vgemba.net/vmware/vmug/Scottish-VMUG-October-2017/)
* [Scottish VMUG Community Blog](https://www.vgemba.net/vmug/Scottish-VMUG-Community-Blog/)

The Terraform series led to me doing a [vBrownbag session](https://www.vgemba.net/vmware/Terraform-vSphere-vBrownBag/). Only from participating in Blogtober led to such a great opportunity.

As Matt explains in the results [post](http://tcwd.net/vblog/2017/11/01/blogtober-results-what-it-means-for-us-all-yes-you-too/) he had 4 times the number of unique visitors he usually had. The numbers for the month for all participants were:

* Total posts by Blogtober bloggers: 340
* Total posts by those bloggers in September, perhaps the most prolific blogging month of the year: 206
* Blogtober Bloggers completing the challenge of 5 posts in October: 41
* How many countries were represented by Blogtober bloggers? 12
* How many continents were represented by Blogtober bloggers? 5

## Blogtober 2018

So Blogtober is back for 2018. So far there are 36 people signed up to participate. The basic requirement is to post 5 times in October. Once again [VMUG](https://www.vmug.com/) have sponsored 3 $100 gift cards for everyone that qualifies. Thanks VMUG!

To enter go to Matt's [post](http://tcwd.net/vblog/2018/09/03/blogtober-2018-tech-edition-its-baaack/) and comment to sign up. All the rules are also listed in the post. So far there are around 50 people that have signed up.

## Wrap Up

I feel like I have been in a blogging slump over the summer so this is just the opportunity to get back on track.

Good luck to all the participants. I can't wait to read the posts.
