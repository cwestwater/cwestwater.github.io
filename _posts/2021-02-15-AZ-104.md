## Introduction

I passed the [AZ-104: Microsoft Azure Administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-104) exam this week to earn the [Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-administrator/) certification.

## Study Material

The key to this exam is the exam skills outline which details everything you may be tested on. This can be downloaded from the [AZ-900](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-104)) page under the skills measured section:

In the end I used a combination of free and paid resources to gain the knowledge to pass. The free content was:

- [Skylines Academy](https://courses.skylinesacademy.com/p/az-104) is a great source of up to date content. Nick is a great trainer and this is highly recommended
- [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/) has a collection of Learning Paths for AZ-104. The links are coming up. Read more about Microsoft Learn in a [previous post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-03-30-Microsoft-Learn %})
- [Thomas Maurer](https://www.thomasmaurer.ch/2020/03/az-104-study-guide-azure-administrator//) has a great post with links to content for each section of the blueprint. I used this a lot to focus in on the correct Microsoft documentation

As I said above Microsoft Learn have the following Learning Paths for AZ-104:

1. [AZ-104: Prerequisites for Azure administrators](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/az-104-administrator-prerequisites/)
2. [AZ-104: Manage identities and governance in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/az-104-manage-identities-governance/)
3. [AZ-104: Implement and manage storage in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/az-104-manage-storage/)
4. [AZ-104: Deploy and manage Azure compute resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/az-104-manage-compute-resources/)
5. [AZ-104: Configure and manage virtual networks for Azure administrators](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/az-104-manage-virtual-networks/)
6. [AZ-104: Monitor and back up Azure resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/az-104-monitor-backup-resources/)

## Free Azure Account

Now watching and reading is great, but you also need to get hands on with Azure. All you need is an email address and no credit card commitment to get the following:

- £150 of Azure credit (time limited to 30 days)
- 12 months of popular free services
- Always free access to 25+ services

Free tip - if the £150 credit in 30 days expires, but register again with a different email address! You can [sign up here](<(https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/free/)>) for your free account.

## Wrap Up

I hope the links about help someone else pass this exam. Next up on the study/certification hit list is [HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate](https://www.hashicorp.com/certification/terraform-associate)
